Hello!!

My name is Leonardo Costa (aka tuxpt) and I am finishing my "MIECT"(Computer and Telematics Enginnering Integrated Master) course at "Universidade de Aveiro". 
I have always been enthusiastic about how a computer system works and because of that My main hobby is learning more about the past, present and future of those computer systems.

My main skills are(many are missing, but I'm a fan of KISS principle, if you don't know what it stands for maybe you are lost):
* GNU/LINUX( Ubuntu&Debian, Centos, OpenSuse, ArchLinux) operation and administration )
* Deployment( Jenkins, Application servers(mainly java ones), Docker Swarm, flatpak, snap, Docker )
* Frontend( QT5, HTML5, Nativescript )
* Backend( C, Java, Python )
* Drinking Beer( a very important one indeed )
* Playing card and board games( not the skill you want ? too bad :(  )
